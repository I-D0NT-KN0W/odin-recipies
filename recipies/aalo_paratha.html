    <h2>Aloo Paratha</h2>
    <p>Aloo means “potato” and paratha means “stuffed flatbread” in Hindi, so the name is quite telling: aloo paratha is an unleavened whole wheat flatbread stuffed with a savory spiced potato mixture.<br>
        In Punjabi families, parathas are made with lots of love and affection, not to mention lots of ghee and butter (makhan). If you lean towards a healthier lifestyle, you can easily opt to roast aloo paratha in oil and serve them with curd (plain yogurt) instead of butter.<br>

    <h2>kadhai paneer</h2>
    <p>Kadai Paneer is a vibrant, tangy, deeply spiced paneer recipe that is perfect for enjoying all year round. Made with Indian pantry staples like onions, tomatoes, capsicum (green bell peppers) and Indian spices, this bright dish comes together in 30 minutes. I share two ways to make this curry – a semi dry restaurant style version and a spicy home style gravy.<br>
        The word kadai refers to a humble piece of Indian cookware; a kadai is similar to a Chinese wok, but with steeper sides and more depth. This entire dish is made in the kadai, and thus the dish is named “Kadai Paneer” or “Karahi Paneer”.<br>
